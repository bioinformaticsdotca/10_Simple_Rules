# Learning Objectives

* Use page headers

# Page Headers

Now that you have templates for each of your content types, you can start creating new pages.  Headers at the top of each one of your pages will allow you to put important information (like the BioSchemas info) in one spot.  This information will then be populated into your page in the spots indicated in your page template.

Page headers are placed at the top of each page between dashes:

```
---
---
```

The header for our example workshop's landing page should look like this:

```
---
layout: workshop_main_1day
permalink: /GOBLET_GitHub_2017
title: GitHub Workshop Setup
header1: Workshop Pages for Students
header2: 10 Simple Rules for Using GitHub for Education
image: /site_images/CBW_bigdata_icon.jpg
---
```

And the header for the tutorial page should look like this:

```
---
layout: tutorial_page
permalink: /rule_5
title: Rule 5
header1: Workshop Pages for Students
header2: Put important information in the page header

Copy these headers into text documents.
