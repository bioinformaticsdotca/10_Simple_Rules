# Learning Objectives  

* Create a team for your workshop  
* Assign the team to your workshop  

# Teams  

Teams are available for organisation accounts.  If you don't have an organisation account, you can assign collaborators.  The advantage of using teams over collaborators is that you can create a team once and then assign the team to existing and new repos as needed.  Collaborators need to be assigned individually to each repo. 

To create a team, in your GitHub account, select `Teams` then scroll down and click on the green `New Team` button.

Give the team a name and description then hit `Create team`.

In the navigation bar, select `Members` then click on the green `Add a member` button.

Type someone's GitHub username (ask your neighbour for theirs!).  This person will receive an invite to join your team if they aren't already a member of your organisation.

To assign your new team to your workshop repo, head over to your workshop repo. In the navigation bar, select `Settings`.

In the sidebar, select `Collaborators and Teams`.

In the Teams box, click on the dropdown menu and select the team you just created.  Note that you can also create a team from this box.

You can change the permissions for each team assigned to your repo.  If this were a private repo and you wanted to give a group access but didn't want them to be able to make changes, you could assign that team *read* permissions.  If you want a team to be able to make changes, for example a group of instructors, you can assign them *write* permissions.  *Admin* permissions allow users to add collaborators to a repo.
