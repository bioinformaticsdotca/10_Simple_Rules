# Learning Objectives  

* Add Google tracking to your website

# Google Analytics

Ever wondered how many people visit your website, how long they spend on each page, what they are looking at, and where they are coming from?  [Google Analytics](https://www.google.ca/analytics/#?modal_active=none) can provide these answers and many more. 

To use Google Analytics, you need to have a Google account. This tutorial **will not** cover setting up a [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en), getting a [tracking code](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en), or analysing the analytics.  It will cover adding a tracking code to your GitHub website.

# Adding Google Analytics to Your Site

The Analytics code should be added to every single page you want tracked.
