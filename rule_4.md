# Learning Objectives

* Know what is FAIR  
* Use metadata to be FAIR  

# Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable

[FAIR guidelines](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) were designed for scientific data and stewardship but are easily appliable to educational resources.

For your workshop materials to be the most useful, learners need to be able to find them (google, links from other sources), they need to be available to anyone, they need to work on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and the contents need to be adaptable or modifiable.

Having your content on GitHub is a good start for accessibility and adding CC-ShareAlike licenses helps with reusability.  Using metadata tags in your page templates will help with Findability.

## Metadata Tags

These are tags that keep the content from being displayed on your site but are machine readable.
